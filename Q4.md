4. (1.0 points) Collaborative filters are essentially how recommendation algorithms work on

sites like Amazon ("people who bought blank also bought blank") and Netflix ("you watched

blank, so you might also like blank"). They work by comparing distances between users. If

two users are similar, then items that one user has seen and liked but the other hasn't seen are

recommended to the other user. What distance metric should you use to compare user to

each other? Given the k-nearest neighbors of a user, how can these k neighbors be used to

estimate the rating for a movie that the user has not seen? In about one paragraph describe

how you would implement a collaborative filter, or provide pseudo-code.

  
  

Collaborative filtering for recommendation systems can utilize various distance metrics, but two common choices are Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The choice between them often depends on the data's nature. Cosine Similarity works well with positive, sparse vectors and is less affected by magnitude, making it suitable for datasets where zero values aren't meaningful. On the other hand, Pearson Correlation accounts for user-specific biases, capturing linear relationships and deviations from the mean, which can be beneficial when rating scales vary across users.

  

Given the k-nearest neighbors of a user (those most similar to our target user based on the chosen distance metric), we can estimate the rating for an unseen movie by taking a weighted average of the ratings given to that movie by the k neighbors. The weight for each neighbor's rating can be their similarity score to the target user.

  

**Pseudo-code for Collaborative Filtering**:

```pseudo

function estimate_rating(user, movie):
    get k-nearest neighbors of 'user' based on chosen similarity metric (either Cosine or Pearson)
    sum_weights = 0
    weighted_ratings_sum = 0

    for each neighbor in k-nearest neighbors:
        if neighbor has rated 'movie':
            similarity = calculate_similarity(user, neighbor)
            sum_weights += similarity
            weighted_ratings_sum += similarity * neighbor's rating for 'movie'

    if sum_weights == 0:
        return average rating of 'movie' by all users
    else:
        return weighted_ratings_sum / sum_weights


```

  

In this approach, if none of the k-nearest neighbors have rated the movie, the function returns the average rating of that movie by all users as an estimate. Otherwise, it returns the weighted average of the neighbors' ratings.
